# TEA Command Reference

Quick reference for all 9 TEA (Test Engineering Architect) workflows. For detailed step-by-step guides, see the how-to documentation.

All workflows listed here are current and supported in TEA, including `nfr-assess`.

**Invocation by tool:**

- Claude Code / Cursor / Windsurf: use slash commands (for example, `/bmad:tea:automate`)
- Codex: use `$` skills from `.agents/skills` (for example, `$bmad-tea-testarch-automate`)
- Custom TEA extensions: package the workflow as custom content/module and attach it to `bmad-tea` via customization. See [Extend TEA with Custom Workflows](../how-to/customization/extend-tea-with-custom-workflows.md)

**Phase:** Phase 3 (system-level), Phase 4 (epic-level)

**Frequency:** Once (system), per epic (epic-level)

**Modes:**

- **System-level:** Architecture testability review (TWO documents)
- **Epic-level:** Per-epic risk assessment (ONE document)

**Key Inputs:**

- System-level: Architecture, PRD, ADRs
- Epic-level: Epic, stories, acceptance criteria

**Key Outputs:**

**System-Level (TWO Documents):**

- `test-design-architecture.md` - For Architecture/Dev teams
  - Quick Guide (🚨 BLOCKERS / ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY / 📋 INFO ONLY)
  - Risk assessment with scoring
  - Testability concerns and gaps
  - Mitigation plans
- `test-design-qa.md` - For QA team
  - Test execution recipe
  - Coverage plan (P0/P1/P2/P3 with checkboxes)
  - Sprint 0 setup requirements
  - NFR readiness summary

**Epic-Level (ONE Document):**

- `test-design-epic-N.md`
  - Risk assessment (probability × impact scores)
  - Test priorities (P0-P3)
  - Coverage strategy
  - Mitigation plans

**Why Two Documents for System-Level?**

- Architecture teams scan blockers in <5 min
- QA teams have actionable test recipes
- No redundancy (cross-references instead)
- Clear separation (what to deliver vs how to test)

**Browser Automation (CLI/MCP):** Exploratory mode (live browser UI discovery)

**How-To Guide:** [Run Test Design](/docs/how-to/workflows/run-test-design.md)

---

## atdd

**Purpose:** Generate failing acceptance tests BEFORE implementation (TDD red phase)

**Phase:** Phase 4 (Implementation)

**Frequency:** Per story (optional)

**Key Inputs:**

- Story with acceptance criteria, test design, test levels

**Key Outputs:**

- Failing tests (`tests/api/`, `tests/e2e/`)
- Implementation checklist
- All tests fail initially (red phase)

**Browser Automation (CLI/MCP):** Recording mode (for skeleton UI only - rare)

**Key Outputs:**

- `test-review.md` with quality score (0-100)
- Critical issues with fixes
- Recommendations

**Scoring Categories:**

- Determinism: 30%
- Isolation: 30%
- Maintainability: 25%
- Performance: 15%

- Category assessments (PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL)
- Mitigation plans
- Gate decision inputs

## trace

**Purpose:** Requirements traceability + quality gate decision

**Phase:** Phase 2/4 (traceability), Release Gate (decision)

**Frequency:** Baseline, per epic refresh, release gate

**Two-Phase Workflow:**

**Phase 1: Traceability**

- Requirements → test mapping
- Coverage classification (FULL/PARTIAL/NONE)
- Gap prioritization
- Output: `traceability-matrix.md`

**Phase 2: Gate Decision**

- PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED decision
- Evidence-based (coverage %, quality scores, NFRs)
- Output: `gate-decision-{gate_type}-{story_id}.md`

**Gate Rules:**

- P0 coverage: 100% required
- P1 coverage: ≥90% for PASS, 80-89% for CONCERNS, <80% FAIL
- Overall coverage: ≥80% required
