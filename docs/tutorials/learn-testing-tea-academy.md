## FAQ

**How long does it take?**
1-2 weeks for new QAs completing all 7 sessions. Experienced engineers can complete in 3-4 hours by jumping to relevant sessions.

**Can I skip sessions?**
Yes! Jump to any session from the menu. Sessions are independent but build on concepts.

**What if I fail a quiz?**
You can review the content and try again, or continue anyway. Your score is recorded.

**Can I retake sessions?**
Yes! Run the workflow and select any session again. It will update your score.
